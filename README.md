ESP-NOW BETWEEN ESP32 CAM AND ESP32
My project is to transmit the data of mq2 gas sensor, dht11, bme280, lcd screen, sound sensor, PIR motion sensor connected to esp32 to esp32-cam with esp-now protocol and then to create a website by collecting sensor data coming from esp32, motor control feature and live camera data thanks to the in1, in2, in3, in4 outputs of my l298n motor driver connected to 4 motors connected to esp32 cam and thanks to the camera it has.
